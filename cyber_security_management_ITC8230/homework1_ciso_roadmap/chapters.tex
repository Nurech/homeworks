\textbf{Student:} Joosep Parts 221963IVCM\\

Taking the assumption, that a typical CISO should be proficient in the following areas I generated a daily checklist (with example
timestamps).

\textbf{Roadmap}\\
\input{tree}

The CISO directs staff in identifying, developing, implementing, and maintaining processes across the enterprise to reduce information
and information technology(IT) risks~\cite[587-588]{HOOPER2016585}.
CISO is bridge the between the executive team and the IT department who must be able to sense what
real risks are and plan accordingly~\cite[261]{10658980701746577}.

\textbf{Foundations}: The foundational aspects of the CISO role, comprising key educational and skill-based competencies.
Fundamental to understanding cybersecurity theories and technologies.
A bachelor's degree forms the groundwork for specialized knowledge. As there are little cybersecurity bachelor's programs, a computer
science or information systems degree is a good starting point.

\textbf{Governance}: Governing policies and compliance to avoid risks.
Ensures compliance with laws and regulations like GDPR and HIPAA.
Compliance frameworks that have legal implications.

\textbf{Operations}: Day-to-day management of security operations.
This core skill is key in defending against cyber threats.
There are tools which can help in intrusion detection and prevention. A CISO must
be familiar with these tools.

\textbf{Strategy \& Finance}: Deals with long-term planning and resourcing.
Investments in long-term assets and keeps an eye on day-to-day expenses that need to be managed efficiently.
Creates teams / departments who can amplify a CISO's effectiveness.

There appears to be no consensus on the exact skills and knowledge required for a CISO~\cite{cotton}.
The role is still evolving and the CISO's responsibilities are expanding.
